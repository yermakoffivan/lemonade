# Add a Custom Model

This guide explains every supported way to add a custom model to Lemonade Server. Start with the CLI workflows below unless you specifically need to hand-edit `user_models.json` or `recipe_options.json`.

## Choose a Workflow

### Pull from Hugging Face or ModelScope

Hugging Face remains the default registry, so existing commands keep working unchanged:

```bash
lemonade pull org/repo
lemonade pull org/repo:Q4_K_M
```

Choose ModelScope explicitly when the model is hosted or mirrored there:

```bash
lemonade pull --source modelscope org/repo
lemonade pull --source modelscope org/repo:Q4_K_M
```

Full model URLs are accepted and select the registry automatically:

```bash
lemonade pull https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF
lemonade pull https://modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF
```

For supported repository layouts, Lemonade lists GGUF quantizations and sharded variants, auto-detects `mmproj-*.gguf` files, infers common labels, and presents the same interactive variant menu for either registry.

Examples:

```bash
# Hugging Face (default)
lemonade pull unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M

# ModelScope
lemonade pull --source modelscope Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M
```

The selected source is persisted with the model registration. Variant discovery, downloads, display links, cache lookup, deletion, and future update checks therefore continue to use the same registry. All checkpoints belonging to one model use one registry source.

Private repositories can be authenticated with `HF_TOKEN` for Hugging Face or `MODELSCOPE_API_TOKEN` for ModelScope. `MODELSCOPE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is also accepted as a compatibility alias. Custom endpoints can be supplied with `HF_ENDPOINT` or `MODELSCOPE_ENDPOINT`.

#### Cache and revision behavior

Both registries share Lemonade's configured `models_dir`. Hugging Face keeps its established `models--org--repo` directory names. ModelScope uses the collision-free `modelscope--models--org--repo` namespace. Under either directory Lemonade uses the same `snapshots/<id>` and `refs/main` structure consumed by runtime resolution and cache cleanup.

Hugging Face snapshots use the immutable commit returned by the Hub. ModelScope downloads use its branch/tag revision (normally `master`); Lemonade derives a stable local snapshot fingerprint from the normalized remote file tree so a changed ModelScope repository is detected even when the branch name stays the same.

The desktop app's manual model form exposes the same source selector. The browse/search catalog remains Hugging Face-backed in this first version; ModelScope models can be added by repository ID through the manual form, CLI, or API.

### Register with explicit CLI flags

Use a `user.*` name plus `--checkpoint` and `--recipe` when you need full control: multiple checkpoints, a non-default recipe, or custom labels.

```bash
lemonade pull user.NAME --source SOURCE --checkpoint TYPE CHECKPOINT --recipe RECIPE [--label LABEL ...]
```

Examples:

```bash
# Register and pull a custom GGUF model with a main checkpoint
lemonade pull user.Phi-4-Mini-GGUF \
    --checkpoint main unsloth/Phi-4-mini-instruct-GGUF:Q4_K_M \
    --recipe llamacpp

# Register and pull a vision model with main + mmproj
lemonade pull user.Gemma-3-4b \
    --checkpoint main ggml-org/gemma-3-4b-it-GGUF:Q4_K_M \
    --checkpoint mmproj ggml-org/gemma-3-4b-it-GGUF:mmproj-model-f16.gguf \
    --recipe llamacpp

# Register a model with multiple labels
lemonade pull user.MyCodingModel \
    --checkpoint main org/model:Q4_0 \
    --recipe llamacpp \
    --label coding \
    --label tool-calling
```

Supported registration flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--source SOURCE` | Remote registry for every checkpoint in this model: `huggingface` (default) or `modelscope`. |
| `--checkpoint TYPE CHECKPOINT` | Add a checkpoint entry. Repeat for multi-file models such as `main` + `mmproj` or `main` + `vae`. |
| `--recipe RECIPE` | Recipe to associate with the new `user.*` model. Common values: <!-- BEGIN GENERATED: recipe-values -->`llamacpp`, `whispercpp`, `moonshine`, `kokoro`, `sd-cpp`, `flm`, `ryzenai-llm`, `vllm`, `thenoise`, `thinksound`, `acestep`, `onnxruntime`, `trellis`, `openmoss`, `collection.omni`<!-- END GENERATED: recipe-values -->. |
| `--label LABEL` | Add a label to the new model. Repeatable. Valid labels include `coding`, `embeddings`, `hot`, `mtp`, `reasoning`, `reranking`, `tool-calling`, `vision`. |
| `--components MODEL [MODEL ...]` | Components for an omni collection (see below). Use with `--recipe collection.omni`. |

### Register an omni collection

A collection is a meta-model made up of components. An **omni collection** is the recipe type behind [Lemonade Omni Models](../../dev/lemonade-omni.md) — registered with `recipe: "collection.omni"`.

Components must already be registered as built-in models or previously pulled `user.*` models. Components do not need to be downloaded already; missing component files are pulled by the same command.

```bash
lemonade pull user.MyKit \
    --recipe collection.omni \
    --components Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF Whisper-Tiny SD-Turbo
```

`lemonade load user.MyKit` loads every component. `lemonade delete user.MyKit` removes only the collection entry; component files stay on disk.

### Register a custom Omni Model from the desktop app

The desktop app offers a UI-driven path to register the same `recipe: "collection.omni"` entry — useful when you want to swap in a different planner LLM or a different image/ASR/TTS backbone without waiting for a new built-in [Lemonade Omni Model](../../dev/lemonade-omni.md) to ship.

1. Register or download the concrete models you want to use in **Model Manager**.
2. In the desktop app menu bar, open **File > New Omni Model > Manually** (or **From JSON** to import an exported one).
3. Pick one planner LLM and any optional models for image generation, image editing, vision analysis, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech.
4. Save the Omni Model.
5. Select the new `user.<name>` entry in the chat model picker — it appears alongside the built-in omni models under the **Lemonade** category.

Custom Omni Models are registered through the same `POST /v1/pull` path with `recipe: "collection.omni"` that the built-ins and the CLI flow above use. They live under the server's `user.*` namespace, so a custom Omni Model named `MyKit` is addressable as `user.MyKit`. They behave like built-in omni models for routing purposes: the selected planner LLM remains the loop driver that decides when to call tools, and optional role models are only loaded/used when their corresponding tool is called.

The Omni Model editor only offers already-registered compatible models for each role:

| Omni Model role | Tool unlocked | Required model capability |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| LLM | Chat loop and tool calls | Concrete chat model, preferably tool-calling capable |
| Vision / image analysis | `analyze_image` | `vision` label |
| Image generation | `generate_image` | `image` label |
| Image editing | `edit_image` | `edit` label |
| Speech-to-text | `transcribe_audio` | `audio` or `transcription` label |
| Text-to-speech | `text_to_speech` | `tts` or `speech` label |

If a component model is deleted later, the Omni Model entry remains registered but is hidden from the chat picker until every referenced component is available again.

The editor also exposes a **System Prompt** field, pre-filled with the shipped default so you can see the text you'd be replacing. Edit it to override the default for this collection only; the override stays a *template* — both the `{tool_list}` and `{tool_guidance}` placeholders are **required** in any custom prompt and the editor blocks save/export when either is missing, because the server expands them at runtime based on which components are present. A collection whose textarea matches the default — or that has been reset via **Reset to default** — stores no override and keeps tracking whatever the global default is at runtime.

### Share a collection: export, import, and model registries

`lemonade export <collection>` (and the desktop app's Export button) writes a *collection file*: the
collection's [`/v1/models/{model_id}`](../../api/openai.md#get-v1modelsmodel_id) object normalized into
an import-ready [`/v1/pull`](../../api/lemonade.md#post-v1pull) body. The file carries `model_name`,
`recipe`, `components`, and a `models` array embedding each component's definition, so it is
self-contained — the importing machine does not need any of the components registered beforehand.
Exported files never contain the user-specific runtime fields `suggested`, `created`, or `downloaded` —
the server regenerates those on import (`suggested` is set to `true` for registered models;
`downloaded` is computed from local files).

The same file works, verbatim, in three places:

- `lemonade import <CollectionName>.json` on the CLI (or **File > New Omni Model > From JSON** in the
  desktop app).
- `POST /v1/pull` with the file contents as the request body.
- Uploaded to a Hugging Face or ModelScope model repo **named after the collection**, so that the
  repo contains `<RepoName>.json`. Pull it with the corresponding source, for example
  `lemonade pull <org>/<repo>` or `lemonade pull --source modelscope <org>/<repo>`. Lemonade
  downloads the manifest, preserves its registry provenance, then registers and downloads every
  component. Inline component definitions inherit the collection source unless they explicitly
  declare their own source.

On import, component names that are already registered keep their local definition (differences from
the embedded definition are logged as warnings); unknown components are registered as `user.*` models
from the embedded definitions.

Example collection file:

```json
{
    "model_name": "user.MyKit",
    "recipe": "collection.omni",
    "checkpoints": { "main": "" },
    "components": ["Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF", "Whisper-Tiny"],
    "models": [
        {
            "model_name": "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF",
            "recipe": "llamacpp",
            "checkpoints": { "main": "unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF:Q4_0" },
            "labels": ["reasoning"],
            "recipe_options": {},
            "size": 0.38
        },
        {
            "model_name": "Whisper-Tiny",
            "recipe": "whispercpp",
            "checkpoints": {
                "main": "ggerganov/whisper.cpp:ggml-tiny.bin",
                "npu_cache": "amd/whisper-tiny-onnx-npu:ggml-tiny-encoder-vitisai.rai"
            },
            "labels": ["transcription", "realtime-transcription"],
            "recipe_options": {},
            "size": 0.075
        }
    ],
    "labels": [],
    "recipe_options": {}
}
```

### Register via API

The `/v1/pull` endpoint accepts the same model registration fields as the CLI. Set `source` to `huggingface` (the default) or `modelscope`; the server canonicalizes and persists it for later update checks. Use this when integrating Lemonade into another app or script:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/pull \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model_name": "user.MyModel",
        "recipe": "llamacpp",
        "source": "modelscope",
        "checkpoint": "org/repo:Q4_0"
    }'
```

For multi-file models, send `checkpoints`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/pull \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model_name": "user.Gemma-3-4b",
        "recipe": "llamacpp",
        "checkpoints": {
            "main": "ggml-org/gemma-3-4b-it-GGUF:Q4_K_M",
            "mmproj": "ggml-org/gemma-3-4b-it-GGUF:mmproj-model-f16.gguf"
        },
        "labels": ["vision"]
    }'
```

For an omni collection, send `components`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/pull \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model_name": "user.MyKit",
        "recipe": "collection.omni",
        "components": ["Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF", "Whisper-Tiny", "SD-Turbo"]
    }'
```

### Edit JSON files directly

Advanced users can edit `user_models.json` and `recipe_options.json` directly. The rest of this guide documents those files and gives complete examples.

## Overview

Custom model configuration involves two files, both located in the Lemonade config directory:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `user_models.json` | Model registry — defines what models are available (checkpoint, recipe, etc.) |
| `recipe_options.json` | Per-model settings — configures how models run (context size, backend, etc.) |

If you used an installer from a Lemonade release, the config directory is typically:

| OS | Config directory |
|----|------------------|
| Linux systemd install | `/var/lib/lemonade/.config/lemonade` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\lemonade` |
| macOS system install | `/Library/Application Support/lemonade/.config` |

For a standalone `lemond` executable, the default config directory is `~/.config/lemonade`. Pass an explicit `config_dir` positional argument if you want persistent JSON files somewhere else; `cache_dir` only controls downloaded/runtime data.

## Model naming spec

Lemonade tracks three sources of models. Every model has a **canonical ID** of the form `<source>.<bare-name>`:

| Canonical ID    | Source                                                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `user.NAME`     | Model registered via `lemonade pull` (entry in `user_models.json`)       |
| `extra.NAME`    | Model imported by dropping a GGUF in `--extra-models-dir`                |
| `builtin.NAME`  | Model compiled into Lemonade's built-in catalog (`server_models.json`)   |

The **bare name** `NAME` is an alias that always resolves to whichever source wins precedence for that name. Precedence is **registered > imported > built-in**.

### What the API emits

`/v1/models`, `/v1/models/{id}`, `lemonade list`, and the Ollama `/api/tags` endpoint emit each model with an `id` set to either:

- the **bare name** if the model is the precedence-winner for its bare name, or
- the **canonical-prefixed ID** if another source outranks it on the same bare name.

For each bare name with collisions, the response contains one bare row plus one canonical-prefixed row per shadowed source.

### What input forms are accepted

Anywhere a model name is accepted (request bodies, CLI args, URL path parameters), all four forms work:

- the bare name `NAME` — resolves to the winner
- `user.NAME` — always the registered model (404 if none)
- `extra.NAME` — always the imported model (404 if none)
- `builtin.NAME` — always the built-in model (404 if none)

`lemonade pull` rejects model names starting with `extra.` or `builtin.` since those prefixes are reserved.

### CLI vs. GUI display

The CLI (`lemonade list`) prints the API `id` verbatim. That means the Name column is always copy-paste-safe — every cell is a valid input to `lemonade load`, `lemonade delete`, `lemonade run`, etc.

The Tauri desktop app and the web app apply a display transformation on top of the API id: bare ids render as `NAME`, and canonical-prefixed ids render as `NAME (registered)` / `NAME (imported)` / `NAME (builtin)`. The suffix appears only for shadowed sources.

### Five reference cases

| Sources                                         | `/v1/models` ids                                      | Resolution                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| built-in `Qwen2.5-Coder` only                   | `Qwen2.5-Coder`                                        | `Qwen2.5-Coder`, `builtin.Qwen2.5-Coder` → built-in                          |
| built-in `Foo` + registered `Foo`               | `Foo`, `builtin.Foo`                                   | `Foo`/`user.Foo` → user; `builtin.Foo` → built-in                            |
| built-in `Bar` + registered `Bar` + extra `Bar` | `Bar`, `extra.Bar`, `builtin.Bar`                      | `Bar`/`user.Bar` → user; `extra.Bar` → extra; `builtin.Bar` → built-in       |
| built-in `Baz` + extra `Baz`                    | `Baz`, `builtin.Baz`                                   | `Baz`/`extra.Baz` → extra; `builtin.Baz` → built-in                          |
| registered `MyModel` only                       | `MyModel`                                              | `MyModel`/`user.MyModel` → user; `builtin.MyModel` → 404                     |

## `user_models.json` Reference

This file contains a JSON object where each key is a model name and each value defines the model's properties. Create this file in your cache directory if it doesn't exist.

### Template

```json
{
    "MyCustomModel": {
        "source": "modelscope",
        "checkpoint": "org/repo-name:filename.gguf",
        "recipe": "llamacpp",
        "size": 3.5
    }
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `source` | No | String | Remote registry: `huggingface` (default) or `modelscope`. Persisted and used for variants, downloads, cache paths, links, and update checks. |
| `checkpoint` | Yes* | String | Registry checkpoint in `org/repo` or `org/repo:variant` format. Use `org/repo:filename.gguf` for GGUF models. |
| `checkpoints` | Yes* | Object | Alternative to `checkpoint` for models with multiple files. See [Multi-file models](#multi-file-models). |
| `recipe` | Yes | String | Backend engine to use. One of: `llamacpp`, `whispercpp`, `moonshine`, `sd-cpp`, `kokoro`, `ryzenai-llm`, `flm`, `collection.omni`. |
| `components` | Yes** | Array | Components for a collection. Required when `recipe: "collection.omni"`. See [Collections](#collections). |
| `size` | No | Number | Model size in GB. Informational only — displayed in the UI and used for RAM filtering. |
| `mmproj` | No | String | Filename of the multimodal projector file for llamacpp vision models (must be in the same registry repo as the checkpoint). This is a **top-level field**, not inside `checkpoints`. |
| `image_defaults` | No | Object | Default image generation parameters for `sd-cpp` models. See [Image defaults](#image-defaults). |

\* Either `checkpoint` or `checkpoints` is required, but not both.
\*\* Required only when `recipe: "collection.omni"`. Collections do not use `checkpoint`/`checkpoints`.

### Checkpoint format

The `checkpoint` field uses the format `org/repo:variant`:

- **GGUF models (exact filename)**: `org/repo:filename.gguf` — e.g., `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF:qwen2.5-coder-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf`
- **GGUF models (quantization shorthand)**: `org/repo:QUANT` — e.g., `unsloth/Phi-4-mini-instruct-GGUF:Q4_K_M`. The server will search the repo for a matching `.gguf` file.
- **ONNX models**: `org/repo` — e.g., `amd/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-quantized_int4-float16-cpu-onnx`
- **Safetensor models**: `org/repo:filename.safetensors` — e.g., `stabilityai/sd-turbo:sd_turbo.safetensors`

### Multi-file models

For models that require multiple files (e.g., Whisper models with NPU cache, or Flux image models with separate VAE/text encoder), use `checkpoints` instead of `checkpoint`:

```json
{
    "My-Whisper-Model": {
        "checkpoints": {
            "main": "ggerganov/whisper.cpp:ggml-tiny.bin",
            "npu_cache": "amd/whisper-tiny-onnx-npu:ggml-tiny-encoder-vitisai.rai"
        },
        "recipe": "whispercpp",
        "size": 0.075
    }
}
```

Supported checkpoint keys:

| Key | Used by | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `main` | All | Primary model file |
| `npu_cache` | whispercpp | NPU-accelerated encoder cache |
| `text_encoder` | sd-cpp | Text encoder for image generation models |
| `vae` | sd-cpp | VAE for image generation models |

### Collections

A collection bundles several already-registered models so they can be loaded, pulled, or deleted as a single entry. Collections do not have their own checkpoint — they reference other models by name. An **omni collection** is a collection type registered with `recipe: "collection.omni"` — this is the recipe behind [Lemonade Omni Models](../../dev/lemonade-omni.md).

```json
{
    "MyKit": {
        "recipe": "collection.omni",
        "components": ["Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF", "Whisper-Tiny", "SD-Turbo"]
    }
}
```

Components must already be registered (built-in models, or other `user.*` entries earlier in this file). Loading the collection (`lemonade load user.MyKit`) loads each component; deleting the collection removes only the collection entry, leaving components on disk.

The equivalent CLI registration is shown in [Register an omni collection](#register-an-omni-collection).

### Image defaults

For `sd-cpp` recipe models, you can specify default image generation parameters:

```json
{
    "My-SD-Model": {
        "checkpoint": "org/repo:model.safetensors",
        "recipe": "sd-cpp",
        "size": 5.2,
        "image_defaults": {
            "steps": 20,
            "cfg_scale": 7.0,
            "width": 512,
            "height": 512
        }
    }
}
```

### Model naming

- In `user_models.json`, store model names **without** the `user.` prefix (e.g., `MyCustomModel`).
- When referencing the model in API calls, CLI commands, or `recipe_options.json`, use the **full prefixed name** (e.g., `user.MyCustomModel`).
- Labels like `custom` are added automatically. Additional labels (`reasoning`, `vision`, `embeddings`, `reranking`) can be set via the `pull` CLI/API flags, or by including a `labels` array in the JSON entry.

## `recipe_options.json` Reference

This file configures per-model runtime settings. Each key is a **canonical model ID** — one of `user.NAME`, `extra.NAME`, or `builtin.NAME` (see the [Model naming spec](#model-naming-spec) above). Each value contains the settings for that model.

### Template

```json
{
    "user.MyCustomModel": {
        "ctx_size": 4096,
        "llamacpp_backend": "vulkan",
        "llamacpp_args": ""
    },
    "builtin.Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct": {
        "ctx_size": 16384
    }
}
```

> **Migration:** Older Lemonade versions stored built-in entries under their bare name (e.g. `"Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct"` with no prefix). On first load with the current version, any bare key matching a known built-in is rewritten to `builtin.<name>` in place. An INFO log line reports the number of migrated keys. Bare keys that don't match a built-in are preserved unchanged.

> **Note:** Per-model options can also be configured through the Lemonade desktop app's model settings, or via the `save_options` parameter in the [`/api/v1/load` endpoint](../../api/lemonade.md#post-v1load).

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Adding a GGUF LLM with large context

**`user_models.json`:**
```json
{
    "Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct": {
        "source": "huggingface",
        "checkpoint": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF:qwen2.5-coder-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf",
        "recipe": "llamacpp",
        "size": 1.0
    }
}
```

**`recipe_options.json`:**
```json
{
    "user.Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct": {
        "ctx_size": 16384,
        "llamacpp_backend": "vulkan"
    }
}
```

(Use `builtin.NAME` here if you're overriding a built-in model's defaults, or `extra.NAME` for an `--extra-models-dir` GGUF.)

Then load the model:
```bash
lemonade run user.Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct
```

### Example 2: Adding a vision model with mmproj

**`user_models.json`:**
```json
{
    "My-Vision-Model": {
        "checkpoint": "ggml-org/gemma-3-4b-it-GGUF:Q4_K_M",
        "mmproj": "mmproj-model-f16.gguf",
        "recipe": "llamacpp",
        "size": 3.61
    }
}
```

### Example 3: Adding an embedding model

**`user_models.json`:**
```json
{
    "My-Embedding-Model": {
        "checkpoint": "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1-GGUF:Q4_K_S",
        "recipe": "llamacpp",
        "size": 0.08
    }
}
```

The model will automatically be available as `user.My-Embedding-Model`. To mark it as an embedding model, use the manual registration flags on `pull`:
```bash
lemonade pull user.My-Embedding-Model \
    --checkpoint main "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1-GGUF:Q4_K_S" \
    --recipe llamacpp \
    --label embeddings
```
Or just `lemonade pull nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1-GGUF` — the `embeddings` label is auto-applied because the repo id contains `embed`.

## Settings Priority

When loading a model, settings are resolved in this order (highest to lowest priority):

1. Values explicitly passed in the `/api/v1/load` request
2. Per-model values from `recipe_options.json`
3. Per-architecture defaults from `architecture_defaults.json` (shipped resource; keyed by GGUF architecture name read from the model file)
4. Global configuration values, see [Server Configuration](./README.md)

**`*_args` merge behavior:** For options ending in `_args` (e.g., `llamacpp_args`, `whispercpp_args`, `sdcpp_args`, `vllm_args`), the CLI/API arguments are **merged** rather than replaced. The merge works at the flag level with higher priority settings taking priority.

For built-in models using `recipe: "vllm"`, also check [`vllm_model_config.json`](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade/blob/main/src/cpp/resources/vllm_model_config.json). Some vLLM families need family-level arguments such as tool-call parser settings; see the [vLLM model-family argument config](./vllm.md#model-family-argument-config) docs before adding or updating vLLM model entries.

For full details, see the [load endpoint documentation](../../api/lemonade.md#post-v1load).
